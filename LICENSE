preamble:
  The licenses accompanying most of the softwares dictate what you're allowed to do.
  That is theoretically unfeasible because ideally creativity can't and shouldn't be encumbered.
  No one should be dictating what you can do.
  Therefore, the aim of this license is to be the one that only dictates what you're
  NOT ALLOWED to do.
